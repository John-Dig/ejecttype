# ejecttype

This was a test repo to play with ejecting, however, vite does not have an eject, so... lol.  

## Still cant get this setup to work.  'react' keeps being underlined, also tags get underlined if App.tsx is in src, but not if it's in root director?  wth?

yarn serve works, yarn dev doesn't seem to render any text.  Pick this project up later.
